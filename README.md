# Movie-Recommendation-System
Course Project for AI 705 Recommendation Systems. We worked on the 1M MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users, by using various methods like Collaborative Filtering, K-Means, SVD

### Notebooks
- `final-collaborative` has the code for User-User and Item-Item based collaborative filtering.
- `kmeans_svd` has the code for Kmeans++ and Reduced SVD Implementation

More about the project can be found in the presentation slide deck.
